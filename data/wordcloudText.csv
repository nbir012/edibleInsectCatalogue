ANTEATER ABOUT PAGE ,"Anteater was formed in May of 2016 when Peter and Bex met at Start-Up Weekend Christchurch.  It's been full steam ahead since then as Anteater has worked tirelessly to bring delicious insects to your favourite restaurant menus and special events.
We acknowledge the imminent crisis surrounding global food security and food sustainability. Due to the major environmental and health benefits of eating insects, we believe that they will play a major role in the future of protein production.
But we know that you won't eat them if they don't taste amazing, which is exactly why we pride ourselves in using fresh, domestic products of the highest possible quality.  We are working with innovative, forward-thinking food producers to put beautiful insect-based dishes on the very best restaurant menus around New Zealand."
CRAWLERS ABOUT PAGE ,"Crawlers is a unique food design brand based in Auckland, New Zealand and was founded in 2013 by Daniel Craig and Matthew Genefaas. 
Crawlers is New Zealand's first brand of edible insects. Some of our ranges include cricket flour, cricket pasta, protein bars, chocolate covered insects, edible centipedes + tarantulas and many more. (view our full range HERE)
All of our edible insects are raised for human consumption in our FDA approved factories around Thailand. They are collected fresh from farms, and have been cleaned, cooked, dried and packaged in a heat sealed bag with an oxygen absorber, ready for you to eat!
Why insects you ask? With the worlds population estimated to be around 9.5 billion by 2050, the way we are feeding the population currently is not going to be sustainable and eventually run out of protein in the forms of meat. So with that said, Crawlers launched with the vision to get every single person in NZ eating insects. We have a large range of edible insects to cater to everyone, whether it be our fun chocolate coated range, our insect flours range or going all in and trying our salted insects range.
For any media or press enquiries please don't hesitate to get in contact with us at hello@crawlers.co.nz."

PRIMAL FUTURE ABOUT/WHY EAT INSECTS PAGE ,"WHY EAT CRICKETS?
THE FUTURE OF SUSTAINABLE NUTRITION
Throughout the ages, insects have been a main protein source in the Paleolithic diets of the earliest hunter-gathers to the modern diets of people all over the world today.  Currently, 80% of the world’s nations regularly eat insects, being a key staple in their diet in Central and South America, Africa, and Asia.
Each year the population increases by around 70 million people. In a 2013 report by the United Nations, it is expected that at this rate of growth, in 2050 the population is expected to be 9.6 billion people.  To be able to meet the nutritional demands of all these people, food production will need to nearly double.  A possible solution, insects!
LAND
Livestock covers 45% of the earth’s total land
According to the FAO, it requires 200m2 of arable land to produce 1kg of beef, but only 15m2 is needed to produce the same 1kg of cricket protein.  70% of arable land goes to meat production, either directly for pasture land or for growing feed for livestock.  Insect farming on average requires much less land due to many innovations including vertical farming techniques, it  is important that we use the space available on Earth more efficiently.
RESOURCES
Worldwide, at least 50% of grain is fed to livestock
According to the FAO, 10,000gms of feed and 22,000ltr (ltrs) of water are needed to produce just 1kg of beef, but only 1,700gms of feed and less than 1ltr of water is required to produce the same amount of protein from crickets. Insects require less food and water per kg of protein, than more traditional protein sources.
ENVIROMENTAL
Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation
 In recent years scientists have become very concerned about how the livestock sector is influencing the world’s climate.  As the international leader in efforts to defeat global hunger the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has made it their mission to promote sources of protein that reduce environmental impacts.  Their report on insects as a protein supply points out that animal agriculture is responsible for “18 percent of Greenhouse Gas emissions (CO2 equivalent), a higher share than the transport sector”.  The UN Environment Programme says that by reducing meat production pressure on the environment and on climate-damaging emissions would be eased.
The average greenhouse gases produced from the production of 1kg of beef is 2,850 grams.  Crickets produce only 1 gram of GHG per 1kg of protein. Farming insects is a more efficient and environment friendly.
NUTRITIONAL
In addition to being environmentally friendly and sustainable source of nutrition, crickets are a great source of nutrition.  In general, cricket powder provides a great source of protein, iron, calcium, B12, and more."
OTAGO LOCUSTS SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS NETWORK PROFILE ,"Otago Locusts is New Zealand’s first and only food-grade insect farm. It sells sustainably-farmed locusts as food for human consumption.
The Food and Agriculture Organization has said that within the next 30 years we will run out of space for traditional agriculture and that we need to find new sources of protein that are more sustainable, such as insects.
Locusts are at least five times more efficient at converting grass into protein compared to beef. They produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases and consume less than 10ml of water per kg produced, making them a viable alternative for the future of food. They take only one month to grow from an egg to a full-sized adult.
Otago Locusts produces between 500 and 1000 market-ready locusts per week. Over the last year it has gained the custom of a number of restaurants nationwide. It has also started making locust flour, which it sees as one of its main future products. It is in a good position to scale production and start a new export industry for New Zealand."
